<h5>Hey little Danny, don't you cry</h5>
<h5>I am you from much later in your life</h5>
<h5>I know your hair is wild, I know you have no style</h5>
<h5>You're still a virgin, and you will be for a while</h5>
<br />
<h5>Danny, don't you know that you are hot as fuck on the inside?</h5>
<h5>Everybody knows the best bananas will be ripe with time</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know that you kick so much ass on the inside?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>
<br />
<h5>Hey little Danny, don't be blue</h5>
<h5>You had a growth spurt and you're suddenly 6'2"</h5>
<h5>The girls are steering clear, you walk like a newborn deer</h5>
<h5>You sent birthday invites, and now all your friend is here</h5>
<br />
<h5>Danny, don't you know that you are cool as fuck on the inside?</h5>
<h5>You're just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know that everyone feels weird on the inside?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>
<h5>Danny, don't you know?</h5>

<strong>A window into your destiny</strong>
<strong>Now you're on tour, and they want more!</strong>
<strong>You step on stage and they come alive</strong>
<strong></strong>No one cares that you're 35</strong>
<strong>You're a rock star, on a centaur!</strong>
<em>(Where'd he get a centaur?)</em>
<strong>You're still a nerdy kid inside</strong>
<strong>But now you've finally found your tribe</strong>
<strong>Hear the crowd roar!</strong>
<strong>Give 'em what they came for!</strong>
<h5>All right, let me hear you!</h5>
<h5>D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy!</h5>
<h5>D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry! (What?)</h5>
<h5>D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost all the time! (Uh...)</h5>
<h5>D-A-N-N-Y, he cries and cries and cries and cries!</h5>
<em>(Okay, thanks guys! Very helpful,</em>
<em>Thank you. Shake it off, shake it off...)</em>
